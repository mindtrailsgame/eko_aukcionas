      "kiaulienos_karbonadas": { "name": "Pork chop (dish with pork)", "reality": "The impact of pork is less than beef but still significant. 1 kg of pork 'costs' about 7-8 kg of CO2e, mainly due to feed cultivation and manure management." },
      "keturiu_suriu_pica": { "name": "Four-cheese pizza (dish with a lot of cheese)", "reality": "Cheese production is the second-largest polluter in the food industry after beef. 1 kg of cheese generates about 10-20 kg of CO2e." },
      "cepelinai_su_mesa": { "name": "Cepelinai with meat and bacon-sour cream sauce", "reality": "Although potatoes are a sustainable product, the meat filling and especially the bacon and sour cream sauce significantly increase the dish's CO2 footprint. It's a combination of the dairy and meat industries." },

      "darzoviu_pica": { "name": "Vegetable pizza with less cheese", "reality": "By halving the amount of cheese and adding more vegetables, a pizza's CO2 footprint can be reduced by more than 40%. Cheese is one of the most polluting ingredients." },
      "bulviniai_blynai": { "name": "Potato pancakes with sour cream", "reality": "Potatoes are one of the most sustainable food products, but sour cream production requires many resources and creates emissions. Dairy products are a significant source of greenhouse gases." },
      "salotos_avokadu_bolivine": { "name": "Salad with avocado and quinoa (imported products)", "reality": "Although the impact is smaller, long-distance transportation and high water consumption (e.g., 1 kg of avocados can require up to 2000 liters of water) leave a footprint." },
      "tofu_sojos_kepsneliai": { "name": "Tofu / soy patties with vegetables", "reality": "Soy products are an efficient protein source with a footprint tens of times smaller than meat. The impact is slightly increased by processing and transportation." },

      "cappuccino_karves": { "name": "Cappuccino (with cow's milk)", "reality": "The vast majority (over 75%) of this drink's CO2 footprint comes from cow's milk. The dairy industry is responsible for large methane emissions and requires enormous land and water resources." },
      "matcha_latte_karves": { "name": "Matcha latte (with cow's milk)", "reality": "Although matcha tea itself is very sustainable, the use of cow's milk makes this drink one of the most polluting. The footprint of the milk completely overshadows the benefits of the tea." },

      "kava_namuose": { "name": "Coffee (made at home, in your own mug)", "reality": "The biggest win is avoiding the disposable cup. However, the cultivation, processing, and transportation of coffee beans from distant countries still leave a small footprint." },
      "matcha_latte_augalinis": { "name": "Matcha latte (with plant-based milk)", "reality": "This is a very sustainable choice. Both matcha tea and plant-based milk (especially oat) have a very low environmental impact." },

      "susiu_rinkinys": { "name": "Sushi set (with salmon, tuna) from Maxima", "reality": "The biggest footprint comes from the fish (especially endangered tuna) and seafood.

      "pringles": { "name": "'Pringles' can", "reality": "Reality: ~0.7 kg of CO‚ÇÇe. This product is an 'ecological nightmare' because of its packaging. The tube is made of multiple materials (cardboard, metal, plastic lid), making it practically impossible to recycle." },
      "bandele_su_desrele": { "name": "Hot dog bun from Maxima", "reality": "The biggest impact comes from processed meat (usually pork), which is resource-intensive to produce.

      "traskuciu_pakelis": { "name": "'Estrella' or 'Oho!' chip bag", "reality": "Reality: ~0.4-0.6 kg of CO‚ÇÇe. Although the chips' footprint is similar, the packaging is a slightly lesser evil than 'Pringles', but it's still made of multi-layered, hard-to-recycle plastic and aluminum foil." },
      "sakotis": { "name": "≈†akotis (a piece of tree cake)", "reality": "This dessert's footprint is inflated by a huge amount of animal products: eggs, butter, and sour cream. Making one kilogram can require up to 50 eggs." },
      "magija_surelis": { "name": "'Magija' curd snack", "reality": "Reality: ~0.3-0.5 kg of CO‚ÇÇe. Dairy production (curd, butter) is resource-intensive. The non-recyclable multi-layered packaging also contributes." },
      "sokoladukas_karuna": { "name": "'Kar≈´na' chocolate bar", "reality": "Reality: The impact heavily depends on the ingredients.

      "tinginys": { "name": "Tinginys (a piece of 'lazy cake')", "reality": "A dessert based on cookies, cocoa, and two dairy products ‚Äì butter and condensed milk. They are the main contributors to the negative impact." },

      "coca_cola_skardine": { "name": "'Coca-Cola' drink (0.33l can)", "reality": "Reality: ~0.3-0.5 kg of CO‚ÇÇe. Aluminum production is extremely energy-intensive, so a can leaves a larger footprint than a plastic bottle." },

      "neptuno_vanduo": { "name": "'Nept≈´nas' water (0.5l plastic bottle)", "reality": "Reality: ~0.15 kg of CO‚ÇÇe. All the damage is done by the plastic packaging and transportation, especially when we have high-quality tap water available in Lithuania." },
      "smetoniska_gira": { "name": "'Smetoni≈°ka' kvass (1l plastic bottle)", "reality": "Reality: ~0.3 kg of CO‚ÇÇe (for the whole bottle). Kvass is often a more local product, requiring fewer complex, imported ingredients and shorter transportation distances." }

      "naujas_telefonas": { "name": "New smartphone", "reality": "About 80% of a phone's CO2 footprint is generated during production. This amounts to about 60-90 kg of CO2e, not including the impact of mining rare metals." },
      "greitosios_mados_drabuzis": { "name": "New fast-fashion item (e.g., jeans)", "reality": "One pair of jeans accounts for about 33 kg of CO2e and ~3,700 liters of water. This is equivalent to driving a car for 111 km and one person's drinking water for 3 years." },
      "humana_drabuzis": { "name": "Item from a thrift store", "reality": "Impact is close to zero as no new demand for production is created. The footprint only consists of transportation to the store." },

For comparison, a new paper book has a footprint of about 1-3 kg of CO2e. However, the big 'but' is the production of the reading device (e-reader, tablet), which is about ~30-50 kg of CO2e. This means for an e-reader to be ecologically worthwhile, you need to read dozens of books on it that you would have otherwise bought in paper form. The most sustainable option is to borrow books from the library!" },

      "socialiniai_tinklai": { "name": "Browsing social media (1-2 hours per day)", "reality": "An hour of browsing generates about 60-120 g of CO2e. The 'cloud' is actually huge, physical buildings that require a lot of energy." },
      "telefono_ikrovimas": { "name": "Charging a smartphone (for the whole week)", "reality": "The charging itself is minor (5-10 g of CO‚ÇÇe), but it's a reminder of the phone's biggest impact ‚Äì its production (60-90 kg of CO‚ÇÇe)." },
